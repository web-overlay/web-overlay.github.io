# Overview

*Web-Overlay* is a toolkit for constructing Web-based overlay network,
where each node (peer) is either a Web browser or a Node.js.  WebRTC
and WebSocket (actually [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)) connections
are used for interconnect.

Web-Overlay includes *Connection Manager* and structured overlay
network, *Kirin*.

Web-Overlay is developed by Kota Abe's research group at Osaka City University
[[Link](https://www.media.osaka-cu.ac.jp/~k-abe/)].

This software is in the early stage of development.

# Documentation

Currently no documentation is available.


# Build
You need a Node.js installed on your computer.

Get the source code from github (as this software is not yet exported
as an npm package).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abelab/web-overlay.git
```

Install [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) locally.
```bash
cd web-overlay
npm install
```

Fetch dependencies
```bash
npx lerna bootstrap
```

Transpile from TypeScript
```bash
npx lerna run build
```

# Play with Demo

In the following setup, all nodes must be on the same host.

## Start an initial node

Initial node (the first node of the overlay network) must be a Node.js node.

```bash
cd web-overlay/packages/demo
env DEPLOYMENT=localhost8080-initial npm run portal
```

Note: `./config/deployment/localhost8080-initial.json` is
used as a configuration file.  

Your initial node will start listening on http://localhost:8080.

```
Run as the initial portal node
- NETWORK_ID: NET-b4bbd842
- LOG_SERVER_URL: http://localhost:8801
- OVERLAY: kirin
- MY_URL: http://localhost:8080
- DEBUG: DEBUG:*
- HTTP ROOT: ..../packages/demo/dist
starting portal node...
initInitialNode succeeded
started: NodeId=cc348211, URL=http://localhost:8080
Command list: status, leave, quit, enable, disable
Prompt>
```

## Join your Web browser 

Access to http://localhost:8080 with your Web browser. 
Enter some key and push Join button.  If everything goes well,
your browser will join the overlay network.
You can join multiple browsers (or multiple windows/tabs) to the network.

# Kirin
Web-Overlay includes an implementation of *Kirin* structured overlay network.

Kirin is a key-order preserving structured overlay network (KOPSON).
In Kirin, each node has a unique key.  You can send a message to a
node by specifying a key (unicast) and also to a set of nodes by
specifing a key range (multicast or range query).

Kirin is a ring-based overlay network, and based on *Suzaku*
structured overlay network, which is based on *Chord#*.

# DDLL 

Kirin uses a modified version of DDLL algorithm for managing
distributed doubly-linked ring structure.  DDLL supports node
insertion, deletion and failure recovery.  This DDLL implementation is
also included in Web-Overlay.
